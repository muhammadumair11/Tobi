                    We at AromaTazeen appreciate our valued customers. However, the client when placing the order agrees
                    to abide by the rules mentioned within this policy & the general policies of ‘Aroma Tazeen’ when
                    placing their order. The brand accepts no liability for clients when in violation of any of the
                    regulations within this policy
                </p>
